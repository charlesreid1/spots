revamp:
- oauth app
- authenticates with flask dance
- creates list of playlists, with checkboxes
- export button will export site


what should spots be able to do?
- core functionality: master list of playlists
- script: spotify client -> (master list) -> master list json
- script: master list json -> (master list) -> spots static site
- fancy pager: panes/views of master list json (for editing)
